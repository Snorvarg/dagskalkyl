Simple helper to keep track of daily expenses, having a monthly budget.

The html-file is run from its folder. Simple as that.

# Usage

1. Find and change sumToSpendEveryDay to the value you can spend maximum every day to keep your monthly budget.
2. Save and load the page in a browser.
3. Start by clicking on the current month, find current day marked in green.
4. Fill in how much you spent today.
5. Keep doing this every day of the month. Fill in zeroes if nothing is spent that particular day.

The idea is: If you spend less money a few days, it means you can spend more money another day! It's a really nice way of trying to save until friday. :)
